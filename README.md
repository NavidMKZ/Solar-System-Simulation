![My Image](scene.png)

This Python code simulates the real-time orbitation of planets around the sun using orbital elements. It calculates the X, Y, Z positions of the planets and their distances from the sun, and visualizes the results.

## Features
* Real-time simulation: Calculate the real-time positions of planets based on their orbital elements.
  
* Visualizations: 3D graphical visualization of the solar system and graphs showing the distance of planets from the sun over time.

* Interactive Controls: Choose which planets to simulate and whether to display distance graphs.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
* Python 3.x

* VPython library for 3D visualization

* datetime module for handling dates and times

### Program Modes
1. The first four planets: simulate Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars.

2. The last five planets: simulate Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto.

3. All: simulates all nine planets.

### Graph Options
Choose whether to display graphs of the distance of each planet from the sun over time.

* planet_fun(time): Calculates the planets' coordinates.
